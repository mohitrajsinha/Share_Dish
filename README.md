# Share_Dish

Share_Dish is an innovative new app that bridges the gap between restaurants and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) - a platform that allows these two entities to connect and share the surplus food left over at the end of the day. Our app is designed to streamline the process of redistributing excess food to those in need while reducing waste and promoting sustainability. With just a few taps on their smartphone, restaurant owners can easily donate food to local NGOs, who can then distribute it to those who are hungry or food insecure.

## Features
- User can log in and signup easily.
- NGOs can look for the food and its quantity and condition.
- NGOs can locate the nearest restaurants in their city.
- They can simply add the products to the cart to process it further.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Flutter and Andriod Studio downloaded on your machine and can run Flutter projects locally.
2. Run the following command to ensure your system meets the requirements to run the app. All requirements must be met to run the app.

```
flutter doctor
```
3. Git clone the project into the directory of your choosing
```
git clone https://github.com/mohitrajsinha/share_dish.git
```
4. Run the following commands to download all required dependencies.
```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```
5. After successfully downloading all dependencies, you are ready to run the app.
```   
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```
It is preferred you run the app on an actual Andriod device or emulator since it was primarily tested on Andriod; however, iOS will also work.

## What's Next
- Introduce a chatbot to answer specific questions and direct users to specific pages.
- Implement a point-reward system, wherein the more contribution from restaurants, the more points they accumulate. They can redeem points for coupons at partner stores.
- Promote the app among various NGOs.
